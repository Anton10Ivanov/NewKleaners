## Design System Rules
- Use shadcn/ui components as foundation - prefer composition over custom styling
- Use CSS variables for theming: `bg-primary text-primary-foreground`
- Never hardcode colors - use design tokens from brand palette
- Use `UnifiedContainer` for all layouts with appropriate sizing
- Follow 8px grid system for spacing consistency

## Brand Color Rules
- **Orange Peel (#ffa000)**: CTA buttons, primary interactive elements, focus states
- **Oxford Blue (#001b2e)**: Navigation, footer, primary text, headers
- **Seasalt (#f7f7f7)**: Main background, card backgrounds
- **Dark Spring Green (#177245)**: Success messages, positive feedback
- **Blue Green (#0d98ba)**: Information messages, help text
- Use CSS variables: `hsl(var(--primary))` instead of hardcoded colors

## Typography Rules
- Use Inter font family as primary
- Follow semantic hierarchy: heading-1 through heading-6
- Use responsive typography with clamp() for fluid scaling
- Maintain proper line heights and letter spacing

## Component Architecture Rules
- Use CVA (Class Variance Authority) for component variants
- Use `React.forwardRef` for components that accept refs
- Include displayName for all components
- Keep components under 50 lines when possible
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces with VariantProps

## Layout & Spacing Rules
- Mobile-first approach with breakpoints: sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px), xl (1280px)
- Touch targets minimum 44px Ã— 44px
- Use responsive classes: `p-4 md:p-6 lg:p-8`
- Follow 8px grid system: 4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px, 96px

## Animation Rules
- Use 60fps animations with transform and opacity only
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` setting
- Standard durations: fast (150ms), normal (300ms), slow (500ms)
- Entrance: fade in with slight upward movement
- Hover: subtle scale (1.02) with smooth transition
- Use Framer Motion for complex animations

## Performance Rules
- Use Next.js Image component for all images with proper sizing
- Use lazy loading for heavy components with Suspense
- Use React.memo for components with stable props
- Import only what you need from libraries
- Optimize bundle size with tree shaking

## Accessibility Rules
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is mandatory
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Include proper ARIA labels and roles
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Color contrast: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- Provide descriptive alt text for images
- Associate form labels with inputs

## shadcn/ui Component Rules
- Import from `@/components/ui/` directory
- Use proper component composition patterns
- Leverage built-in variants: default, secondary, outline, ghost, destructive
- Use appropriate sizes: sm, default, lg, icon
- Compose components properly with Card, CardHeader, CardContent, etc.

## Container System Rules
- Use `UnifiedContainer` for all layouts
- Size options: sm (672px), md (896px), lg (1152px), xl (1280px), 2xl (1400px), full
- Padding options: sm, md, lg, xl, or boolean for responsive
- Use `breakout` prop for hero sections
- Use `center` prop for centered content

## Code Quality Rules
- Single responsibility principle for components
- Proper error handling with try-catch
- Loading states for async operations
- No console.log in production code
- Use proper TypeScript types - never `any`
- Follow established import organization patterns
